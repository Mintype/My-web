            <h3>My 6th Grade Experience - Last Updated June 30, 2019</h3>
            <h4>
                       <pre>   </pre>My 1st day of 6th grade at Woodrow Wilson Middle School was September 7th, 2019. When I first came, I was already 3 days late. When I arrived, the school seemed small to me. But, when I got inside, it was like a mansion. I wasn’t expecting it to be this big. Of course it was a shocker to me to see it. The first day, my classes were all over the place. Upstairs, downstairs, upstairs and downstairs, etc. The classes that I had downstairs were confusing because the classes were in areas where barely anybody went. But, I still got to my classes. The rest of the year I found my classes much more easily.<br> 
                The first marking period, I had a lot of missing assignments in math because there used to be so much homework that I did not know what was homework and what wasn’t. Then later on I found where to find my homework. Mrs. Marrocco had posted it in my google classroom. It was called “MarroccoMath” Homework Calendar 2018-19. Because of that I rarely got any missing assignments. In my english class, I had a classmate kept talking about a teacher which threw most of the people off task. It was really annoying when you kept getting irritated. I could barely focus because of that.<br>
                In 6th grade I had a couple of friends. Can you guess how many friends I have? I have about 10 friends that I talk to a lot. 10 is better than nothing. Some of these friends moved, Having someone to talk to didn’t make me feel lonely. It felt as if I had some company. Most of them were in a lot of my classes. Having some friends is good and doesn’t make you feel as if you are the only person in the school. <br>
                The second marking period went a little better than the first because I got better grades than the first marking period. My grades were either B+s, A- or A+s. They increased my overall grade. This was one of the best grades that I have ever gotten in my school life. This marking period, I joined the Indian Cultural Club. In this club, we made food and made things to celebrate Indian festivals such as Holi, Gudi Padwa, Diwali. We even celebrated things for Christmas and Halloween. In Social Studies, we learned about Egypt and India. It was actually fun. We learned new things while having fun. In Science, we were learning about fossils and different types of rocks. Since I had already learned about it, it wasn’t as exciting as the S.T.E.M. project.<br>
                The third and Fourth Marking Period were the best! I got very high grades. By this time I had a lot of friends and knew exactly where my classes were. I also started health in the fourth marking period. Because of health, I missed out on the fitness days where I had to run 8 laps around the field in a limited time. That really tired me out.<br> 
                Every grade in Woodrow Wilson has a field trip. But this year  6th grade didn’t have it because there were too many students. But in exchange for a field trip we had a field day. Now that made some of the 7thand 8th graders jealous. That was actually some good news to hear. <br>
                The last day of school was really OK. We only watched movies and during Health we went to the gym and all we did was sit there and talk for the entire class. In English we watched Middle School: The Worst Years of my life. In Social Studies, we watched Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief. In french, we watched Hugo. In Band, we watched Wonder. In Science, we watched Bedtime Stories. My favorite movie was Wonder. It was my favorite movie because it actually expresses what happens in Middle Schools. <br>
